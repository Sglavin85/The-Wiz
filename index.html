                        <h2>We are not in Harlem anymore</h2>
                        <p>The Wiz is a 1978 American musical adventure fantasy film produced by Universal Pictures and Motown Productions, and released by Universal Pictures on October 24, 1978. A reimagining of L. Frank Baum's classic 1900 children's novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz featuring an all-black cast, the film was loosely adapted from the 1974 Broadway musical of the same name. It follows the adventures of Dorothy, a shy, twenty-four-year-old Harlem schoolteacher who finds herself magically transported to the urban fantasy Land of Oz, which resembles a dream version of New York City. Befriended by a Scarecrow, a Tin Man and a Cowardly Lion, she travels through the city to seek an audience with the mysterious Wiz, who they say is the only one powerful enough to send her home.</p>

                                <h3>Silver Slippers</h3>
                                <p>In the funky African-American musical version of L. Frank Baum's classic tale The Wiz, in the 1974 Broadway play, the 1978 Motown film, and the 2015 NBC production, Dorothy's shoes are kept silver like in the original book. Glinda instructs Dorothy, through the song "Believe in Yourself", that in order for the shoes to take Dorothy home, the girl must believe that she can go where she wants, then click her heels three times. In live performances of the musical (including the play and the NBC telecast), Dorothy still wears the Silver Slippers when she returns to Kansas, unlike the book, and the dialogue suggests that she can use them to both leave and revisit Oz.</p>
                                <p>However, the movie shows Dorothy wearing ordinary shoes when she returns to her aunt's and uncle's home. Earlier, the movie also showed that the Silver Slippers have a safeguard against thieves, as the Wicked Witch Evillene's fingers painfully curled over backwards when she attempted to steal the shoes from Dorothy.</p>
